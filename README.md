# Claude Code Any Buddy
⚠️ Not tested on Windows, if claude session does not start after using this tool use the restore command or you may need to reinstall claude code. I have tested this on linux and mac and seems to work well

Pick any Claude Code companion pet you want.

```bash
npx any-buddy@latest
```

That's it. Follow the prompts to choose your species, rarity, eyes, hat, and name.

Claude Code assigns you a deterministic pet based on your account ID — you can't change it through normal means. This tool lets you choose your own species, rarity, eyes, and hat, then patches the Claude Code binary to make it happen.

## How it works

Claude Code's companion system generates your pet's visual traits (species, rarity, eyes, hat) by hashing your user ID with a salt string (`friend-2026-401`), then feeding that hash into a deterministic PRNG (Mulberry32). The result is always the same pet for the same user — and it's recalculated on every launch, so you can't override it through config files.

**claude-code-any-buddy** works by:

1. **You pick** your desired species, rarity, eyes, and hat through an interactive TUI
2. **Brute-force search** finds a replacement salt string that produces your chosen pet when combined with your real user ID (typically takes <100ms)
3. **Binary patch** replaces the salt in the compiled Claude Code ELF binary (all 3 occurrences) using an atomic rename, with a backup created first
4. **Auto-repair hook** (optional) installs a `SessionStart` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` that re-applies the patch after Claude Code updates

The patch is safe — it uses `rename()` to atomically swap the binary, which is the same technique package managers use. A running Claude session continues using the old binary in memory; the new pet appears on next launch.

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 18** — for the CLI and TUI
- **Bun** — required for hash computation (Claude Code uses `Bun.hash`/wyhash internally; FNV-1a produces different results). Bun is typically already installed if you have Claude Code
- **Claude Code** — installed via any standard method

### Platform support

| Platform | Status | Binary location (auto-detected) |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Tested | `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>` |
| macOS | Tested | `~/.local/bin/claude`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`, `~/.claude/local/claude` |
| Windows | Should work | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\claude\claude.exe`, npm global shim |

The binary is found automatically via `which`/`where` and platform-specific known paths. If auto-detection fails, set `CLAUDE_BINARY=/path/to/binary` manually.

## Install

The interactive flow also lets you **rename** your companion — it edits `~/.claude.json` directly so the name change takes effect immediately.

## Install

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/cpaczek/any-buddy.git
cd any-buddy
pnpm install

# Link globally (optional, enables the apply command for auto-patch hook)
pnpm link --global
```

Or via npm:

```bash
npm install -g any-buddy
```

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive pet picker (default) — pick your pet and apply
claude-code-any-buddy

# Show your current pet
claude-code-any-buddy current

# Browse and preview pets without applying
claude-code-any-buddy preview

# Re-apply saved pet after a Claude Code update
claude-code-any-buddy apply

# Silent re-apply (used by the SessionStart hook)
claude-code-any-buddy apply --silent

# Restore original pet
claude-code-any-buddy restore

# Delete companion so Claude Code re-hatches a fresh one on next /buddy
claude-code-any-buddy rehatch

# Non-interactive with flags (skip prompts you already know the answer to)
claude-code-any-buddy --species dragon --rarity legendary --eye '✦' --hat wizard --name Draco --yes
```

## Customization options

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/options.svg" alt="Customization options" width="700">
</p>

### Rarities

| Rarity | Stars | Normal odds | Stat floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Common | ★ | 60% | 5 |
| Uncommon | ★★ | 25% | 15 |
| Rare | ★★★ | 10% | 25 |
| Epic | ★★★★ | 4% | 35 |
| Legendary | ★★★★★ | 1% | 50 |

Common rarity pets get no hat. All other rarities roll a random hat.

### Eyes

Six eye styles available on every species:

| Style | Character |
|---|---|
| Dot | `·` |
| Sparkle | `✦` |
| Cross | `×` |
| Circle | `◉` |
| At | `@` |
| Degree | `°` |

### Hats

Seven hat styles (only for uncommon+ rarity):

```
crown       tophat      propeller   halo        wizard      beanie      tinyduck
 \^^^/       [___]        -+-       (   )        /^\        (___)         ,>
```

### Stats

Each pet has 5 stats: **DEBUGGING**, **PATIENCE**, **CHAOS**, **WISDOM**, **SNARK**. One peak stat, one dump stat, rest scattered. Higher rarity = higher stat floor. Stats are deterministic from the seed — you can't pick them individually, but different salts produce different stat rolls.

### Shiny

1% chance per seed. The interactive flow asks if you want shiny, or pass `--shiny` on the command line. Requiring shiny takes ~100x longer to find a matching salt (seconds instead of milliseconds) since only 1 in 100 seeds produce a shiny pet.

## How the auto-patch hook works

When you choose to install the hook, it adds this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "claude-code-any-buddy apply --silent"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook is **optional and defaults to No** — you'll be asked during the interactive flow. If you prefer, just run `any-buddy apply` manually after Claude Code updates.

On every Claude Code session start, this runs `apply --silent` which:
1. Reads your saved salt from `~/.claude-code-any-buddy.json`
2. Checks if the current binary already has the correct salt (fast `Buffer.indexOf`)
3. If not (Claude updated), re-patches — same string replacement, same logic
4. Silent mode: produces no output unless a patch was actually applied

The hook adds negligible startup time (~50ms) when no patch is needed.

## How the binary patch works

Claude Code is a compiled Bun ELF binary at `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<version>`. The salt string `"friend-2026-401"` appears exactly 3 times:
- 2 occurrences in the bundled JavaScript code sections
- 1 occurrence in a string table / data section

The patch:
1. Reads the binary into a buffer
2. Finds all 3 occurrences of the old salt
3. Replaces each with the new salt (always exactly 15 characters — same length, no byte offset shifts)
4. Writes to a temp file, then atomically renames it over the original
5. Verifies by re-reading

The atomic rename (`rename()` syscall) is safe even while Claude Code is running — the OS keeps the old inode open for any running process. The new binary takes effect on next launch.

A backup is always created at `<binary-path>.anybuddy-bak` before the first patch.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude.json` | Read-only — your user ID is read from here |
| `~/.claude-code-any-buddy.json` | Stores your chosen salt and pet config |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | SessionStart hook is added here (optional) |
| `<binary>.anybuddy-bak` | Backup of the original binary |

## Restoring

```bash
# Restore original pet and remove the hook
claude-code-any-buddy restore
```

This patches the salt back to the original, removes the SessionStart hook, and clears the saved config.

## Limitations

- **Tested on Linux and macOS** — Windows should work but is not yet tested. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/cpaczek/any-buddy/issues) if you hit problems
- **Requires Bun** — needed for matching Claude Code's wyhash implementation
- **Salt string dependent** — if Anthropic changes the salt from `friend-2026-401` in a future version, the patch logic would need updating (but the tool will detect this and warn you)
- **Stats partially selectable** — you can pick which stat is highest (peak) and lowest (dump), but not exact values
- **Personality** — generated by Claude on first `/buddy` run after patching, not controlled by this tool. Delete the `companion` key from `~/.claude.json` to re-hatch with a new personality
- **Speech bubble** — your buddy's speech bubble reactions are generated by Claude based on the personality and name stored in `~/.claude.json`. After patching the visual, the buddy will still *talk* like the original personality unless you update it. Use the interactive prompt or `--personality "your description here"` to change what your buddy says
- **Name** — can be changed at any time via the interactive flow or `--name` flag (edits `~/.claude.json` directly)
