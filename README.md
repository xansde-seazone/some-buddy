# Claude Code Any Buddy

Windows is now supported for NPM-based installs of Claude Code — thanks @jtuskan ([#5](https://github.com/cpaczek/any-buddy/pull/5))!

macOS ad-hoc code signing after patching — thanks @aaronepinto ([#3](https://github.com/cpaczek/any-buddy/pull/3))!

Pick any Claude Code companion pet you want.

```bash
npx any-buddy@latest
```

That's it. Follow the prompts to choose your species, rarity, eyes, hat, and name.

Claude Code assigns you a deterministic pet based on your account ID — you can't change it through normal means. This tool lets you choose your own species, rarity, eyes, and hat, then patches the Claude Code binary to make it happen.

## How it works

Claude Code's companion system generates your pet's visual traits (species, rarity, eyes, hat) by hashing your user ID with a salt string (`friend-2026-401`), then feeding that hash into a deterministic PRNG (Mulberry32). The result is always the same pet for the same user — and it's recalculated on every launch, so you can't override it through config files.

**any-buddy** works by:

1. **You pick** your desired species, rarity, eyes, and hat through an interactive TUI
2. **Brute-force search** finds a replacement salt string that produces your chosen pet when combined with your real user ID (simple searches take milliseconds; shiny/legendary/custom stats can take minutes)
3. **Binary patch** replaces the salt in the Claude Code binary using an atomic rename, with a backup created first
4. **Auto-repair hook** (optional) installs a `SessionStart` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` that re-applies the patch after Claude Code updates

The patch is safe — it uses `rename()` to atomically swap the binary, which is the same technique package managers use. A running Claude session continues using the old binary in memory; the new pet appears on next launch.

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 18** — for the CLI and TUI
- **Bun** — required for hash computation (Claude Code uses `Bun.hash`/wyhash internally; FNV-1a produces different results). Bun is typically already installed if you have Claude Code
- **Claude Code** — installed via any standard method

### Platform support

| Platform | Status      | Binary location (auto-detected)                                             |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | Tested      | `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>`                                      |
| macOS    | Tested      | `~/.local/bin/claude`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`, `~/.claude/local/claude` |
| Windows  | Tested      | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\claude\claude.exe`, npm global `cli.js`            |

The binary is found automatically via `which`/`where` and platform-specific known paths. If auto-detection fails, set `CLAUDE_BINARY=/path/to/binary` manually.

## Install

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/cpaczek/any-buddy.git

## Customization options

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/options.svg" alt="Customization options" width="700">
</p>

### Rarities

| Rarity    | Stars | Normal odds | Stat floor |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Common    | ★     | 60%         | 5          |
| Uncommon  | ★★    | 25%         | 15         |
| Rare      | ★★★   | 10%         | 25         |
| Epic      | ★★★★  | 4%          | 35         |
| Legendary | ★★★★★ | 1%          | 50         |

Common rarity pets get no hat. All other rarities roll a random hat.

### Eyes

Six eye styles available on every species:

| Style   | Character |
| ------- | --------- |
| Dot     | `·`       |
| Sparkle | `✦`       |
| Cross   | `×`       |
| Circle  | `◉`       |
| At      | `@`       |
| Degree  | `°`       |

### Hats

Seven hat styles (only for uncommon+ rarity):

```
crown       tophat      propeller   halo        wizard      beanie      tinyduck
 \^^^/       [___]        -+-       (   )        /^\        (___)         ,>
```

### Stats

Each pet has 5 stats: **DEBUGGING**, **PATIENCE**, **CHAOS**, **WISDOM**, **SNARK**. One peak stat, one dump stat, rest scattered. Higher rarity = higher stat floor. You can choose your peak (best) and dump (worst) stat via `--peak` and `--dump` flags, but exact values are determined by the seed.

### Shiny

1% chance per seed. The interactive flow asks if you want shiny, or pass `--shiny` on the command line. Requiring shiny takes ~100x longer to find a matching salt (seconds instead of milliseconds) since only 1 in 100 seeds produce a shiny pet.

## How the auto-patch hook works

When you choose to install the hook, it adds this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "any-buddy apply --silent"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook is **optional and defaults to No** — you'll be asked during the interactive flow. If you prefer, just run `any-buddy apply` manually after Claude Code updates.

On every Claude Code session start, this runs `apply --silent` which:

1. Reads your saved salt from `~/.any-buddy.json`
2. Checks if the current binary already has the correct salt (fast `Buffer.indexOf`)
3. If not (Claude updated), re-patches — same string replacement, same logic
4. Silent mode: produces no output unless a patch was actually applied

The hook adds negligible startup time (~50ms) when no patch is needed.

## How the binary patch works

Claude Code is a compiled Bun binary (ELF on Linux, Mach-O on macOS) or a JS bundle (`cli.js` on Windows via npm). The salt string `"friend-2026-401"` appears 3 times in the compiled binary (Linux/macOS) and once in the JS bundle (Windows).

The patch:

1. Reads the binary into a buffer
2. Finds all occurrences of the old salt
3. Replaces each with the new salt (always exactly 15 characters — same length, no byte offset shifts)
4. Writes to a temp file, then atomically renames it over the original
5. Verifies by re-reading
6. On macOS, re-signs the binary with an ad-hoc signature (`codesign --force --sign -`)

The atomic rename (`rename()` syscall) is safe even while Claude Code is running — the OS keeps the old inode open for any running process. The new binary takes effect on next launch.

A backup is always created at `<binary-path>.anybuddy-bak` before the first patch.

## Files

| File                            | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude.json`                | Read-only — your user ID is read from here                                  |
| `~/.claude-code-any-buddy.json` | Stores your chosen salt and pet config (legacy name kept for compatibility) |
| `~/.claude/settings.json`       | SessionStart hook is added here (optional)                                  |
| `<binary>.anybuddy-bak`         | Backup of the original binary                                               |

## Restoring

```bash
# Restore original pet and remove the hook
any-buddy restore
```

This patches the salt back to the original, removes the SessionStart hook, and clears the saved config.

## Limitations

- **macOS code signing** — on macOS, the binary is automatically ad-hoc re-signed after patching to avoid code signature invalidation. If Claude Code won't launch after patching, run `any-buddy restore`
- **Requires Bun** — needed for matching Claude Code's wyhash implementation
- **Salt string dependent** — if Anthropic changes the salt from `friend-2026-401` in a future version, the patch logic would need updating (but the tool will detect this and warn you)
- **Stats partially selectable** — you can pick which stat is highest (peak) and lowest (dump), but not exact values
- **Personality** — initially generated by Claude on first `/buddy` run after patching. You can customize it via the interactive flow or `--personality "your description"`. Delete the `companion` key from `~/.claude.json` to re-hatch entirely
- **Speech bubble** — your buddy's speech bubble reactions are generated by Claude based on the personality and name stored in `~/.claude.json`. After patching the visual, the buddy will still _talk_ like the original personality unless you update it. Use the interactive prompt or `--personality "your description here"` to change what your buddy says
- **Name** — can be changed at any time via the interactive flow or `--name` flag (edits `~/.claude.json` directly)
